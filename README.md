# Hor Ji Xuan - Regov Question 1 

## WebApp with User Registration, Sign-On screen/module, and User Profile interface built with only React JS

Step 1: Register page
- min username length is 4
- min password length is 8

Step 2: Login page
- has to the option to reregister account in case forget password 
- since it is using state, the previously registered account is erased from the state when back to register page

Step 3: Profile page
- profile image is a default Kucoin logo
- registered name and email will be shown
- log out and log in back using same credentials
- edit and save about me section
- (hint: editing without save and log out, edited text does not persist)

This web app is built purely with React JS with huge focus on state management for simulating data persistence.
